This is the Hono backend for the chat app : CORPO CHAT that I'm developping as the final project of my WebDev formation.

So far the biggest coding challenge I've given myself, this app is aimed to be a simple chat app that allows you to create conversations between 2 or more users.

What is'nt so simple is the fact that I decided (for now) to not use advanced libraries to develop this app but rather doing a lot from scratch, and that my formation forbid the usage of ORM libraries to attest my capacity of understanding SQL.
